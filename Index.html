        I am Atanda Oluwatimileyin, a student at the Federal University of

      <p>
        I am Atanda Oluwatimileyin, an undergraduate student at the Federal
        University of Technology Akure (FUTA). My journey into web development
        began in 2021 with an introduction to HTML and CSS. Initially, it was a
        casual exploration, but it didn't go too far because I thought it was
        too hard for me to learn. However, a recent educational experience at
        Alt School, which began three months ago, reignited and deepened my
        passion for frontend development.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I delve into the intricacies of coding and design, I have found a
        new love for creating interactive and visually appealing web
        experiences. Even though I am on the Cloud Engineering Track with the
        Student ID ALT/SOE/024/0160, I still love frontend development.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy reading books,
        which offers me a diverse range of insights and inspiration. My journey
        as a budding developer is marked by a commitment to continuous learning
        and a growing enthusiasm for the world of coding.

      <h3 id="WhyAltSchool">Why AltSchool</h3>
      <p>
        I wanted a platform that allows me to take a self-paced course in tech
        while keeping me committed through weekly interactions and structured
        examinations. AltSchool provided more by introducing Learning Circles
        and other useful skills like technical writing. I might not have had so
        much reason before choosing Alt School, but I don't regret that decision.
